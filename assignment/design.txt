Thougth Process:
        First of all user add their car model and add it's parts with its ,parts name ,parts number ,level number .
        like in the example table Model A-2017 has a parts that name "Door Auto1" thats level number is 1 and parts number is 1.
        In the same model car Parts name "Auto Lock"  thats parts number 2 and level number 3.
        
        I use two database table for store CarModel and it's parts.
        Then i convert  CarModels and parts in a array datastructure
        For table show i use the array to table 
        and for graph show i use this array for convert graph datastructure
        Finally i use HTML <canvas> for relation with line of every parts of car
 
 I choose this design because from array data structure  it is easy for expecting output.
